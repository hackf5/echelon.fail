title: The Widen Nash Road Party
subtitle: ...a party political manifesto
description: Nash Road is a critical thoroughfare in the local area, but for too long it has been a source of frustration and danger for local drivers. The road is narrow, with carriageways running in both directions and a 60 mph speed limit, and it is often necessary to veer into the verge to avoid a collision. The party is founded on the belief that Nash Road has the potential to significantly reduce congestion around the QEQM hospital and the local area's main shopping mall, but it is currently a no-go area for many local drivers.

## Introduction

The issue of Nash Road has been a persistent concern for the local community for many years. As a resident and frequent driver of the road for the past 25 years, I have seen firsthand the dangers and difficulties posed by its narrow and poorly designed carriageways. Despite its potential to reduce congestion and improve access to key destinations such as the QEQM hospital and the main shopping mall, the road's inadequate design has made it a no-go area for many drivers.

In light of these ongoing challenges, it is time for decisive action to be taken to address the issue of Nash Road and to make it a safer, more accessible, and more efficient road for all. With this in mind, I have founded the "The Widen Nash Road" party to bring attention to this important issue and to advocate for the necessary changes to be made.

This manifesto will outline the party's vision for Nash Road, the policies and actions we will take to achieve it, and the benefits that will accrue to the local community as a result. We believe that by working together, we can bring about the positive change that Nash Road so desperately needs.

## Problem Statement

Nash Road has long been a source of concern for the local community due to its narrow and poorly designed carriageways, which pose significant risks to drivers and make it a difficult road to navigate. Despite its potential to reduce congestion and improve access to key destinations such as the QEQM hospital and the main shopping mall, the road's inadequate design has made it a no-go area for many drivers, who are forced to find alternative routes or to endure slow and stressful journeys.

This situation is unacceptable and must be addressed. The "The Widen Nash Road" party is committed to finding a solution to the problems posed by Nash Road and to making it a safer, more accessible, and more efficient road for all. By working together with the local community, we will bring about the positive change that Nash Road so desperately needs.

## Vision

The vision of the "The Widen Nash Road" party is to create a safer, more accessible, and more efficient road that serves the needs of the local community. We see a future in which Nash Road is widened to accommodate two-way traffic, with a reduced speed limit of 40 mph that enhances road safety and allows drivers to move through the area with confidence. Our vision also includes the addition of a dedicated dual use cycle lane and footpath, providing safe and convenient options for cyclists and pedestrians, as well as improved access to key destinations such as the QEQM hospital and the main shopping mall, reducing congestion and making it easier for local residents to reach these important locations.

By achieving this vision, the "The Widen Nash Road" party will create a road that is safe, efficient, and accessible for all, and that enhances the quality of life for the local community. With this vision in mind, we will work tirelessly to make Nash Road the road that it should be, for the benefit of all, including drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike.

## Policies and Actions

1. **Community Outreach:** The first step in the process will be to poll the local community to gauge their level of support for the issue of Nash Road and to understand their concerns and priorities. This will help us to build a more informed and representative platform, and to engage in meaningful and productive discussions with the local community.

1. **Negotiations with Landowner:** Assuming there is sufficient support for the issue, the next step will be to engage in a dialog with the landowner to attempt to negotiate a fair and reasonable price for the necessary land. We believe that this is the preferred option, as it will allow us to minimize the impact on the landowner and to work together to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.

1. **Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO):** In the event that negotiations with the landowner are unsuccessful, the party will consider the issuance of a compulsory purchase order (CPO) to acquire the necessary land. This will be a last resort and will only be pursued if all other options have been exhausted and if it is deemed to be in the public interest.

1. **Budget Development:** Once a mechanism for acquiring the land has been established, whether through negotiations with the landowner or through the issuance of a CPO, the next step will be to put together a detailed budget for the road-widening project, taking into account all of the costs associated with acquiring the land, widening the road, and making any necessary improvements.

1. **Funding:** The party will engage with home builders in the area, who are likely to be the greatest beneficiaries of the project and who have built many homes recently that have only served to add to the congestion, to explore additional funding opportunities. If sufficient funding is not secured privately, the party will also seek funding from national sources to support the road-widening project. If sufficient funding is still not secured, additional funds will be sought locally, but only from non-essential services and excluding pothole repair. The party believes that this combined approach will deliver the project at minimal cost to the local residents.

1. **Planning and Scheduling:** Having secured the necessary funding, the next step will be to engage with local town planners and the national highways agency to plan and schedule the work. This will involve extensive coordination and consultation with the relevant authorities and stakeholders to ensure that the project is executed according to the highest standards and in compliance with all relevant regulations and guidelines.

1. **Construction:** The actual construction of the road-widening project, including the excavation and widening of the road, the construction of any necessary retaining walls or drainage systems, and the laying of the new road surface. This will be carried out by the contractors selected during the planning and scheduling phase, and will be subject to close supervision and monitoring by the relevant authorities.

1. **Monitoring and Evaluation:** Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the road-widening project, to ensure that the project is delivered on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards. This will include regular site inspections, quality control checks, and performance reviews to ensure that the project is executed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications.

1. **Operations and Maintenance:** Upon completion of the road-widening project, the responsibility for the ongoing operations and maintenance of the road will be transferred to the relevant government organizations. These organizations will be responsible for the upkeep of the road surface, the maintenance of any drainage systems, and the repair of any damages or defects that may occur over time.
   
    The planning and scheduling process will include:

   - Detailed design and engineering work to ensure that the road-widening project is executed to the highest standards and in accordance with all relevant regulations and guidelines.
   - Procurement of materials and equipment, and selection of contractors to carry out the work.
   - Development of a detailed project schedule, taking into account the lead times for procurement of materials, the availability of contractors, and any other relevant constraints.
   - Coordination with local town planners to ensure that the project is executed in accordance with the local land use plans and development policies.
   - Coordination with the national highways agency to ensure that the project is executed in accordance with the national highways standards and policies.

## Conclusion

The party's focus is solely on the issue of Nash Road, and its goal is to successfully deliver the road-widening project. Once the project has been completed and the road has been widened, the party will be disbanded. The party's vision is to leave a lasting legacy for the local community by successfully delivering the road-widening project.
