Karl Popper, a renowned philosopher of the 20th century, was known for his views on tolerance and freedom. In his book, _The Open Society and Its Enemies_, Popper famously wrote:

> Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.

This quote highlights Popper's belief that a tolerant society can only exist if its citizens are willing to defend it against intolerance. He argues that if a society is too tolerant and allows intolerance to flourish, it will eventually lead to the destruction of tolerance itself and in this sense is often quoted as a bulwark against fascism. However, it can be interpreted differently and to see how it is necessary to provide a working definition of fascism.

## Fascism

Fascism is a political ideology characterized by the manipulation of a dominant _in-group_ and the marginalization of perceived _out-groups_ through authoritarian means. The goal of this dynamic is to maintain control and power over society, with the boundaries of the _in-group_ and the _out-group_ being subject to change and manipulation by those in power. This ideology often results in the suppression of political opposition and dissent, the establishment of a single-party dictatorship, and the use of propaganda and mass media to manipulate public opinion and control the narrative. The glorification of the nation and its people, as well as racist and prejudiced beliefs, may be used to define the boundaries of the _in-group_ and the _out-group_, but these are not defining characteristics of the ideology.

## Misinterpretation

It is easy to see how from the definition of fascism given above Popper's quote can be interpreted as fascistic if taken out of context and applied in a manner that prioritizes the domination of a perceived _in-group_ over perceived _out-groups_. In this interpretation, the tolerance of the _in-group_ is seen as unlimited, while the tolerance of the _out-group_ is seen as limited and subject to being suppressed. 

If a society misunderstands Popper's views on tolerance it follows that it is at risk of becoming fascistic.

It's important to note that this is not a direct result of Popper's views, but rather a misinterpretation of them. Popper's views on tolerance and freedom were complex and nuanced, and he was likely warning against the dangers of fascism, rather than endorsing it.

## Notes

ChatGPT struggled with this.

It did very well in constructing the definition of fascism, it was important to me that the definition is based on the concepts of _in-group_ and _out-group_, this is not my idea, but something I read years ago in an out of print book that I no longer have access to and has stuck with me.

It was able to understand that nationalism and racism are symptoms of this dynamic, not defining characteristics although it took a lot of coaxing. In order to interpret Popper as fascist a very abstract definition is necessary. I'm undecided as to whether it is necessary for a fascist state to be authoritarian, or whether that is a natural consequence of the core dynamic, personally I think it weakens the definition because it allows fascism an out.

However, it really struggled to overlay Popper on top of this definition. It kept coming back to reiterating the fact that Popper was not a fascist and going back to details that were not relevant to the argument.

> **Q:** let's assume a hypothetical fascist state. it, by definition, has an *in-group* and an *out-group*. in that fascist state the *in-group* is known as *tolerant* and the *out-group* *intolerant*. my point is that read verbatim popper's quote is an endorsement of fascism. can you summarize this?

It seems pretty clear to me, but I guess this level of deduction and reasoning is beyond it.

What I've attempted here is an unorthodox interpretation of two separate ideas. One idea, the definition of fascism, needed to be reframed in a certain way and then using this reframing the second idea neatly lays on top of it in a way that inverts its original meaning.

If I wanted to write an essay on how Popper was a bulwark against fascism then I'm sure ChatGPT would have pumped something out, but here it basically failed.

So if I wanted to set an essay that could not be written by ChatGPT I would set one that challenged the status quo.

Given that ChatGPT is considered such a threat to the university system one should probably now draw one's own conclusions about the quality of education it is now providing.
