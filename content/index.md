> **A:** "Echelon" is a word that has been used to describe the hypothetical future event in which artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence and becomes the dominant form of intelligence on the planet. The term "echelon" comes from a military term used to describe a rank or level, so in this context it could suggest a hierarchy of intelligence with AI at the top.

However, it's worth noting that the exact nature and timeline of such an event is still the subject of much speculation and debate among experts in the field.

Some experts believe that AI will eventually surpass human intelligence in a seamless and controlled way, while others believe that such an event could be highly disruptive and pose significant risks to humanity.
